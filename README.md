## About Webhook Mailer

Webhook Mailer is a PHP library that replaces the sending of contact emails (sender: user / recipient: me)

## How it works?

The webhook mailer, as the name implies, was developed with webhooks with requests through the guzzlehttp library.

## When should I use this library?

When the recipient was you, example: form on the contact page.

## Comparison with email common sending?

We will soon have a performance comparison.
